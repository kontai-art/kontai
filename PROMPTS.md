# Image Prompts (OG + Hero + Cases)

## OG / Social (1200×630)
Minimal dark editorial banner showing an abstract immersive space: soft volumetric light beams intersecting,
fine particle field, elegant conic gradients in indigo (#7A89FF) and mint (#59E3C7), subtle grid hint in the background,
high contrast, premium look, clean negative space for title overlay, photographic realism mixed with digital light art, no text.
Negative: no logos, no people, no brand marks, no UI, no watermarks, no text overlay.
Aspect 1200:630, detail high, noise low, sharpness medium.

## Hero (1920×1080)
Immersive showroom/experience space in a dark environment: a kinetic light sculpture visualising live energy data as flowing ribbons
and particle streams, indigo and mint light accents, soft volumetric haze, reflective floor, elegant minimal architecture,
premium photographic lighting, high dynamic range, no audience, no logos.
Negative: no logos, no text, no recognizable people, no clutter.
Aspect 16:9.

## Cases
(Use similar language; keep abstract, no client logos, no people.)
- Energy Flower (1600×900): radial light-blade sculpture, live grid data as pulses; indigo core glow, mint highlights.
- Climate & Oceans (1600×900): oceanic light strata and particle currents across walls/floor; bathymetry-like contours (abstract).
- Utility Pilot (1600×900): anonymised, floor mint light arcs, wall nodes and grid; data-as-path aesthetic.
- Embodied Interaction (1600×900): translucent holographic plane, reactive waves, spatial audio halos.
- Sustainability Hub (1600×900): modular wall tiles with embedded light strips reacting to ESG metrics.
- University Lab (1600×900): freestanding “data sculpture” column with internal light filaments reacting to API feeds.
