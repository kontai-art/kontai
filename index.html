        <h2>What we deliver</h2>

        <p>
          We build <strong>interactive spaces that explain things</strong>.
          When something is too big, too technical or too invisible to describe with words,
          we make it something people can actually experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          It can be a wall that lights up with live energy data.  
          A surface that reacts when someone moves their hand.  
          A room that shows climate change as colour and motion instead of numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          People don’t just watch.
          They try it. They react. They ask questions.
          And we quietly capture that reaction — what they touched, where they stayed, what sparked interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          So you don’t just tell your story.
          You <strong>see what parts of it actually work</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This leads to <strong>clearer communication, faster buy-in and fewer lost opportunities</strong>.
          In practice that means faster internal approval, smoother funding talks,
          and better return on every euro you spend on communication, exhibitions or events.

          <h3>The Energy Flower (Fingrid)</h3>

          <p><strong>The challenge:</strong>  
          The national grid operator needed to show how electricity is moving across the country,
          second by second. For most people “the grid” is invisible and abstract.</p>

          <p><strong>What we built:</strong>  
          A large light sculpture that breathes with live grid data.  
          When consumption spikes, the light pulses faster.  
          When wind power rises, the colour shifts cooler.</p>

          <p><strong>The result:</strong>  
          School groups, media and policymakers could finally <em>see</em> what’s happening.
          Fingrid told us meetings about renewables are now “faster and calmer”
          because everyone shares the same mental picture.</p>

          <p class="impact">
            <strong>Impact:</strong> fewer explanations needed, less time defending the system,
            smoother stakeholder talks → real time saved, less friction.

          <h3>Climate &amp; Oceans — Immersive Room</h3>

          <p><strong>The challenge:</strong>  
          Marine scientists were trying to secure funding, but graphs and PDFs were not
          making people feel the urgency of ocean warming.</p>

          <p><strong>What we built:</strong>  
          A calm, walk-in space where the light and sound shift based on real temperature
          and acidity data from the sea. When the water warms, the whole room “warms.”</p>

          <p><strong>The result:</strong>  
          Donors said “now I finally see what this means.”
          It turned climate change from numbers to something physical you can stand inside.</p>

          <p class="impact">
            <strong>Impact:</strong> helped unlock new funding conversations and increased
            follow-up interest by double digits.

          The company’s visitor centre felt like a textbook on a wall.
          Guests left confused. Kids got bored. Adults didn’t stay.</p>

          <p><strong>What we built:</strong>  
          A long interactive wall where light flows like electricity through cables.
          You touch wind, nuclear, hydro, solar — the wall shows where that power goes.</p>

          <p><strong>The result:</strong>  
          Visitors stayed longer, asked smarter questions, and actually understood
          what happens between “power plant” and “my socket.”</p>

          <p class="impact">
            <strong>Impact:</strong> ~2× increase in dwell time, satisfaction up from 3.1 → 4.8/5,

          But slides weren’t landing — nobody felt the value.</p>

          <p><strong>What we built:</strong>  
          A small portable setup for the boardroom.
          When you move your hand in the air, projected visuals respond in real time —
          showing what the system is doing and why it matters.</p>

          <p><strong>The result:</strong>  
          Instead of “let me explain it,” it became “try it.”
          Leadership finally felt how the system behaves — and signed off.</p>

          <p><strong>What we built:</strong>  
          A hanging light sculpture that pulses and changes colour with live research data.
